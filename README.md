# Planned updates
* More code cleanup/refactoring
* Proper themes support (at least light and dark, likely with a cookie to save the selection as an individual preference)
* More example functions (the logistic map isn't everything)
* Auto-updating sliders (i.e., slide to change a value and the diagram is regenerated accordingly)
